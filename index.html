    <h3>Project</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><h4> A Secure File Sharing System | Go </h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed an end-to-end encrypted file sharing system</li>
                <li>Utilized cryptographic library functions for public/private key encryption, digital signatures, and HMACs, ensuring
                    data confidentiality and integrity</li>
                <li>Built secure login for user focusing on password security and multi-device support</li>
                <li>Developed methods for storing, loading, and appending files, optimizing bandwidth efficiency, and handling various
                    file sizes</li>
                <li>Developed secure file sharing among users including the creation and management of file access invitations and the
                    ability to revoke access</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><h4>  Build Your Own World | Java </h4></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Designed a randomized 2D tile-based game world using procedural generation techniques, creating diverse terrains
                    such as rooms, hallways, and obstacles</li>
                <li>Utilized Java and StdDraw graphic libraries to render graphical game components, translating abstract data
                    representations into visually cohesive game scenes</li>
                <li>Developed a real-time user interface to allow dynamic interaction, enabling player movement, world navigation, and
                    various in-game actions</li>
                <li>Added a light-switch feature to restrict the character’s field of vision to augment the level of challenge</li>
                <li> Implemented a save/load system, enabling game states to be stored and retrieved using serialization, enhancing the
                    user experience by allowing continuity across sessions</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
